			<h3>Concert 1</h3>


			<div class="piece" id="Vittoria">
				<p class="piece_title">Geometria Vitale</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
				<p class="composer">Gianni Dell Vittoria</p>
				<p class="notes">The piece represents the concept of vital survival filtered through a geometric vision
					of nature.
					It is as if the vital impulses were carried to the extreme boundary between existence and
					non-existence.
					Technically it is built on the Bohlen_Pierce intonation, a system of pitches set to the centrality
					of the 12th, rather than the 8th.
					All sounds are synthesis sounds made entirely with Csound


			</div>


			<div class="piece" id="Rossato">
				<p class="piece_title">Caged Structures IV </p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
				<p class="composer">Alessio Rossato</p>
				<p class="notes">Dynamic and temporal structure of this work is inspired by the J. Cage's piece
					7’10.554” for a
					percussionist, specifically the electronic realization of a voice/line (A - All Others) of the
					score, left
					(freely) interpretable by John Cage who did not exclude a realization (freely) with
					electronic/electroacoustic devices supports already in 1956... Realized the line A
					“electroacoustically” usable for the performance with a percussionist (original version of the
					score),
					this electronic material is elaborated and re-organized to give shape to different acousmatic
					pieces.
					The acoustic material is modeled, redesigned and sculpted to shape new pieces with common source
					material. In this way a sort of wide range of sound variations / sculptures is generated which see
					material as the main focus in the relationship between space and the vibrational energy (timbre) of
					sound. I then created a layering of the resulting “voices“ reaching the overlap of 28 independent
					voices (Digital Tracks) divided into periods. The periods are delimited by reverberated sound events
					and granulated events. My main interest is the spatial dramaturgy of music, which in this case
					allowed me to work on at least three spatial planes at the same time, hoping to have created a
					musical
					event that would transmit a totally immersive and engaging experience.

			<div class="piece" id="Janevska1">
				<p class="piece_title">Impro Duo </p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Instruments and Live electronics</p>
				<p class="composer">Marijana Janevska & Joachim Heintz</p>
				<p class="notes">This piece is an improvisation with voice and live electronics (ALMA).
					Throughout the improvisation different atmospheres/moods/expressions are
					built by exploring different sounds produced by the voice, like: breathing,
					whispering, humming and so on, while being recorded, analyzed, transformed and
					played back in different ways by ALMA. The communication and interaction
					between the voice and the electronic instrument is extremely important-
					they are sometimes treated like one entity, layering on top of each other
					and sometimes like two opposites.

			<div class="piece" id="Balighi">
				<p class="piece_title">Daramad</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
				<p class="composer">Ali Balighi</p>
				<p class="notes">In Persian, “Daramad” means to start music and also, it is a classical
					form of Persian music, however, it means to learn music with a deep perspective to
					theory and techniques for me. In this music, I tried to make a connection between
					language from a sense point of view and fixed media as a musical atmosphere.
					The relation between sopranos parts is based on rhythm, counterpoint movements,
					nonmeaning words and alone letters.
					This piece won the third place in the fifth international Reza Kourorian
					electroacoustic composition competition, and was played in the forth tehran
					international electronic music festival (TIEMF 2021)

			<div class="piece" id="Sosa1">
				<p class="piece_title">Jazz </p>
				<p class="composer">Jean-Basille Sosa</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
				<p class="notes">Jazz, without being essentially jazz or pop, looks like yet a bit
					jazz and pop music. Electroacoustic work originally composed
					for the dance, it is also for the situation of the concert
					situation. In its acousmatic concert version Jazz gives to hear
					more distinctly the principles of an ‘electronic writing’ which
					from an initial set of abstract formal ideas deploys a material
					physiologically palpable, embodied to the sensory.
					A specific consideration on the musical time as well as on the
					rhythm perception is in the heart of this work, both popular
					and abstract.

			<h3>Concert 2</h3>


			<div class="piece" id="Francioni">
				<p class="piece_title">...e sempre di mirar faceasi accesa</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
				<p class="composer">Enrico Francioni</p>
				<p class="notes">The work wants to return the sound image evoked in the mind of
					the Supreme Poet who in Paradise is overwhelmed by the One who with "Amore",
					"muove il sole e le altre stelle".
					The crescendo corresponds to the approach to the divine [0'00"-6'26"],
					to reach a blinding sound texture that I love to approach the encounter with
					the Immanent [5'00"-6'26"], unspeakable state of grace suspended and suddenly
					interrupted [6'26”] to lead us elsewhere; perhaps to reality [6'26"-8'00"].
					In this sense the painting tries to make its own the concepts of "Inaudible"
					and "Thresholds of perception", but also of continuous flow, circularity,
					harmony, song and dance, the latter, well described by William Mahrt.
					It is the idea of immobility that is aimed at, which implicitly underlies the
					silence, here conceived not as the absence of sound, but as a state of general expectation.

			<div class="piece" id="Yang1">
				<p class="piece_title">Ganges River Empties Itself into Ocean</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
				<p class="composer">Wanjun Yang</p>
				<p class="notes">The title of the piece comes from the Buddhist classics,
					Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra. Buddha said that form is emptiness and emptiness is form.
					We come to the world with bare hands, spend our lives pursuing material
					things and desires, and finally remain naked, taking nothing with us.
					This piece uses a single Buddha singing bowl as the musical instrument,
					which is one of the commonly used Dharma instruments in Buddhism.
					The main sound material is the sound of strike and resonance of the
					bowl, different sound modules are designed in Csound, the sound of the bowl
					striking is picked up by microphone, processed in real time by digital signal processing.
					The musical form of the piece is A-B-A', which expresses the process of
					human being from the true nature at birth, to being lost in the material world, and then to realize
					the true meaning of life.

				<p class="notes">Shin Kubota is a marine biologist at Kyoto University
					and research on a species of jellyfish, Turritopsis dohrnii. If one
					of these jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress or to physical
					aggression, if it is sick or just old, it loses its tentacles, sinks
					to the bottom of the sea and returns to its primitive stage, thus
					forming a new colony. This process can continue indefinitely, making
					this creature biologically immortal.</p>

				<p class="piece_title">Kagemusha: for Live Pipa and Csound </p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Instruments and Live Electronics</p>
				<p class="composer">Ningxin Zhang</p>
				<p class="notes">Inspired by Akira Kurosawa's film “Kagemusha”,
					this duet for live pipa and electronics aims to depict how people
					struggled in the cruelty and impermanence of ancient wars, as well
					as the prosperity and end of a turbulent era. Musically, the pipa
					playing and electronics are always echoing each other in the whole
					piece. It starts with electronic sounds and slowly introduces the
					playing of pipa. The acoustic pipa part follows traditional pipa
					form and shows a variety of techniques of the left and right hand.
					All the electronic sounds were generated based on the melodies played
					by both acoustic pipa and Csound pipa, and were processed mainly with
					Cecilia, Puremagnetik plugins and Cabbage modulation, spectral and time
					effect plugins to create the dark atmosphere, the ferocious metallic
					sounds of swords colliding and a state of chaos that people were suffering from.</p>

				<p class="piece_title">Lightcycle</p>
				<p class="composer">Niall O’Connor</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed Media</p>
				<p class="notes">The underlying aim of the piece is to use lightbulb's
					as a musical instrument and to examine all the different aspects
					of it by looking at the finite life cycle of a lightbulb, from
					when it first gets turned on to its inevitable demise.
					The different stages the lightbulb passes through would parallel stages of a
					human life. The piece was originally intended as a reflection of my life at
					the time and while the subject matter was open enough to allow me to explore
					the usage of texture in the piece. The materials and aesthetics in the
					piece draw from varying aspects of my life and present them in one overarching
					theme, for example some of the electrical hum’s are based around a recording
					of meat been prepared. At the time I was completing an apprenticeship in butchery as an extension of
					my love for culinary arts. </p>

				<p class="piece_title">Hope – DSPoemscape </p>
				<p class="composer">Aman Jagwani</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed Media</p>
				<p class="notes">This piece is a soundscape for the poem Hope Is The Thing With Feathers by Emily
					Dickinson.
					It feautures the recitation of the poem with an evolving underscore supporting and creating an
					immersive
					atmosphere for it. It also features a harmonic and melodic composition that flows
					with the ethos of the poem.

				<p class="piece_title">Seven Trumpets </p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed Media</p>
				<p class="composer">Chris Arrell</p>

				<p class="notes">I was especially interested in combining digital
					additive and subtractive synthesis techniques with algorithms
					generating aleatoric panning processes while writing Seven Trumpets.
					The result is a series of vast spectral chords that coalesce and dissolve
					as their requisite frequencies fuse and diverge in time and space.
					These chords, or trumpets, serve as large-scale structural pillars throughout the composition..</p>

					texture manipulated by clusters developed from the single recording.
					It used granular synthesis as the main method digital alteration.</p>

				<p class="notes">Initiated by Laura Muncaciu, Love is a mixed
					music project for soprano and electronics based on five texts by
					George Herbert (1593 - 1633), poet and English clergyman.
					Like a songbook,the five poems chosen for this composition determine a
					musical work in five parts that constitute a kind of testimony

				<p class="piece_subtitle">Instruments and Live Electronics</p>
				<p class="composer">Labdi Ommes, Bernt Issak Wærstad & Alex Hoffman</p>
				<p class="notes">This piece takes its title and inspiration from experiments
					in cultural evolution research that are used to identify the type of
					information that is more easily passed on from one person to another.
					Starting from 3 solo compositions of each of the three performers, a
					live Csound performance will be developed remotely. The different
					compositions will be based on vocal/orutu, guitar and saxophone sounds.
					Each performer sends their solo composition to one of the other collaborators
					who then adds material to this foundation. Using the cosmo-dsp Csound effect
					library, the material will be modified into electro-acoustic compositions.

					These multi-layer tape-music recordings will then be used as source material
					for a live-performance of the trio at the ICSC. Since all three performers
					are based in different countries, this procedure allows them to work remotely towards a
					live-performance.

				<p class="piece_title">Ideale Landschaft Nr. 6 </p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed Media</p>
				<p class="composer">Clemens Von Reusner</p>
				<p class="notes">"Ideale Landschaft Nr. 6" (engl. Ideal Landscape No. 6) was inspired by
					European landscape painting of the 17th and 18th centuries and by an etching by the German artist
					Ernst von Hopffgarten.
					This etching was the untitled sixth part of a cycle called "Variations in G".
					Although the composition is not a setting of the graphic etching, there are structural similarities.
					The sound material consists of sounds created mainly with "Csound" using additive and subtractive

				<p class="piece_title">Nuk(넋) for Live Contrabass and Csound </p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Instruments and Live Electronics</p>
				<p class="composer">Hyunkyung (Luhee) Shin</p>
				<p class="notes">The title "Nuk" is a Korean word for the soul, or spirit,
					and represents a non-material and supernatural being that is considered
					to govern the body and mind in a person's body. This piece is a solo song
					for Contrabass. This is an approach of personal unconsciousness to the
					collective unconscious, a central concept discussed in Karl Jung's analytical
					psychology, a very personal but at the same time innate structural domain
					that exists in a group, and a memory of tears that permeates without learning.
					It can be expressed as the concept "한," and this sentiment contains both
					perceptions of life and futility. The piece expresses sentiments expressed
					through sound through individual emotion-level experiences, which combine
					bass sounds with various effects using Csound to reveal the characteristics
					of human life that cannot be expressed in a single melody.</p>

				<p class="piece_title">Resemblance</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed Media</p>
				<p class="composer">Emiliano del Cerro</p>
				<p class="notes">Resemblance is a piece designed as homage to Charles Dodge and it is related to voice
					analysis processing and computer music composition.
					The basic material is based on children songs and came from the idea by Noam Chomsky that describes
					that children recognize the
					contour and melodic patterns of his mother voice that the semantic meaning of the words
					According with this theory the melodic contour of general children songs and lullabies are very
					similar all over the world.
					The piece is an electroacoustic work with prerecorded sound precedent from children songs, female
					voice and acoustic recorder.
					The main DSP algorithm used came from cross synthesis, LPC phase vocoding and shuffling of
					musical motifs and sentences.

				<p class="piece_title">To The Rain </p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed Media</p>
				<p class="composer">Stefano Cucchi</p>
				<p class="notes">You can hear the rain, and you can also feel the rain, the vibrations,
					the flow of waves of rain and the singles drops.
					The rain changes to a new life when beating on different surfaces.
					The metamorphosis of sound is closely linked to different directions;
					the rain can slip and wash, or fill, or soak.
					The rain in something that strikes and beat externally but also
					affects our inner poetic imagery, so “rain” is a starting point
					for an inner journey in which every gesture is connected to an
					memory of rain. “To” the rain means also asking to the rain and stay listening and wait.

				<p class="piece_title">27 Ossos </p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Instruments and Live Electronics</p>
				<p class="composer">Luis Antunes Pena</p>
				<p class="notes">27 OSSOS is a piece for one performer playing two drums with
					lights, relays, sensors, piezo microphones, microcomputer and video projection.
					The percussionist takes control of the whole performance playing the two drums
					with his hands and also by activating the sensors that control light and sound.
					Our hands have 27 bones, 33 muscles and 3 nerves but besides that they can be a
					repository of information of the long life experience, of accumulated habits and
					movements they stored. The starting point for the composition where the hands
					both as sound producer and sound controller as well as a carrier of symbolic meaning.
					The composition of the piece followed and is the result of the construction of
					the instrument which includes the two drums, the video projection, the electronics
					and its sensors. This piece was made in a close collaboration with Nuno Aroso.

				<p class="piece_title">Ghost Quartet</p>
				<p class="piece_subtitle">Live Electronics</p>
				<p class="composer">Marijana Janevska</p>
				<p class="notes">"The piece “Ghost quartet” for violin, voice and live electronics,
					is connected to and inspired by Beethoven’s “Grosse Fugue” and Beckett’s
					theatre play “Play”. The material is built upon the decoupling of the melodic,
					rhythmical and gestural aspects of the theme of Beethoven’s fugue, while the
					structure of the piece is derived from Beckett’s theatre play. The piece uses
					three speakers that, together with the player, form a "ghost quartet”.
					Everything that is played live is being recorded and then played by the speakers
					building a kind of a double cannon, that is being more and more distorted.
					There is a dialog between the violin, voice and electronics where the musical
					gestures pass from one to the other, but at the same time merging into one meta-sound,
					where it is difficult to distinguish what is played live and what comes from the speakers.

				<p class="notes">The exchange is the sharing knowledge. Sharing a soundscape means to somehow understand

					During the compositional journey, the two soundscapes meet, merge, until the pursuit for symbiosis
					and the study
					of its symbolic limits. Mixing the sounds of San Romano and of the Ville de Québec, creates a sense
					of profound
					friendship between the two locations.
					The piece was made starting from field recordings made in Qubec City (Canada) and in San Romano, a
					small village
					in central Italy.
					The recorded materials were transformed with Csound in time (slowing down) and in frequency (Shift)
					also using
					glissandi lenses. The sound textures we hear are "compressions" in the frequency space. Synthetic
					sounds are
					used to integrate parts of the composition and are created through a simple sine wave generator.

				<p class="notes">Arctic Cave is a 1 minute and 46 second noise piece exploring the limits of noise. Made
					using a

					picture of a
					winter wanderer taking refuge in a cave as the storm outside takes its course. Using fibonacci

					piece aims to explore and harness the musical capabilities of using noise as a sound source, and
					through this,
					discover how its limitations can uncover beauty.

				<p class="notes">Púrpura (“Purple”, in Portuguese) is a generative piece fully written in Csound. In my
					mind I
					always associated the word with the concept of blossoming and I wanted to translate that feeling
					into the piece
					by creating a soundscape that swells in and out like it’s breathing.
					The piece consists of four instruments, Bass, Pad, Glide, and Bell, with every instrument sharing
					the same basic
					system for generating sound, but with their own twists. Each time an instrument plays, it selects a
					random note
					from the B lydian scale (within a more specific pool for each instrument), pays it for a random
					duration, and
					waits a random amount of time before repeating the cycle.
					Púrpura is also the title track of my latest EP, consisting of 5 ambient generative pieces that
					explore
					different affects that can be achieved with a simple system like this one.

				<p class="composer">Mark Ferguson</p>
				<p class="notes">Machair (Gaelic; roughly pronounced ‘mah-hur’): fertile, wildflower-rich grassland
					habitat found on
					the northwestern coastlines of Scotland and Ireland.

					Five sonic impressions, composed out of source materials gathered around the Hebridean Island of
					South Uist in
					August 2019:

					Open grassland with red clover and knapweed, from Daliburgh to Askernish. Thistle, burdock, ragwort
					and
					Yorkshire fog grass internals. Great yellow bumblebee queen (reconstructed nest interior). Bumblebee
					mating
					activity (reconstructed nest entrance). North Atlantic surf under dark clouds, from the ancient
					burial grounds
					at Cladh Hallan.

					The piece was constructed exclusively out of my own wildlife/nature source recordings (all made on
					South Uist),
					with Csound playing a pivotal role in delicately shaping sonic materials: particularly those with
					strong
					gestural bases. In combination with GRM Tools SpaceGrain and finely tuned Reaper EQ, a Csound
					instrument with
					randomly modulated granular processing parameters (largely based on randomi > grain interactions)
					was used to
					process contact microphone recordings of island vegetation (thistles, burdock, knapweed, etc.),
					open-air
					recordings of wind and grass, and rare great yellow bumblebee recordings (to create imaginary
					swarms). My main
					intention with the piece was to use Csound to subtly augment recorded gestural contours and create
					imaginary
					behaviours based on field experiences, bringing the listener down to ground or ‘great yellow
					bumblebee’ level.

					by the
					processing to find their way to the pre-defined modern jazz fusion end section of the piece. Every

				<p class="notes">This work experiments with the relations between music movement and voice recognition.
					A literal
					imitation of the voice is not intended, but an ambiguous one. There is an ambiguous continuity
					between the vocal
					timbre and timbres quite related to voice changing by morphing. To provide it, I have used a voice
					synthesis
					system based on format synthesis (FOF algorithm). I never use parameters set too near to the human
					voice, there
					is always a parameter that is different from the human voice recognition perspective. Sometimes the
					voice is
					reckonable, sometimes not, and this is different for each person but the patch is always the same,
					depending on
					how the music evolves. Sometimes the voices work together in such a way that they are heard just as
					a single
					voice or provide critical band interferences from which individual voices can arouse. Giordani, who

					<p class="notes">My 8-channel work is a radical interpretation of the monophonic acousmatic piece
						Doppelrohr 2'
						by Bengt Hambraeus – a piece composed in 1955 after the acoustical properties of the eponymous
						organ stop.
						For the sonic reshaping of Doppelrohr 2’ I moved from two Late Renaissance organ related
						practices pertinent
						to registration and spatialization, i.e. from the Italian Antegnati school and from Dutch
						sources. The term
						contrafactum refers to the medieval practice of assigning a new text to a given melody; the verb
						contrafacere means to imitate but also to set in opposition. Hambraeus recalls that for
						Tinctoris a notated
						composition is indeed a res facta, something written out that is reconfigured by every
						performance. In this
						case the original text is not a score but an analog tape and its new sonic configuration is a
						matter of
						digital overwriting.

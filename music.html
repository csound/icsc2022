	  <p class="piece_title">Geometria Vitale</p>
	  <p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
	  <p class="composer">Gianni Dell Vittoria</p>
	  <p class="notes">The piece represents the concept of vital survival filtered through a geometric vision of nature. 
        It is as if the vital impulses were carried to the extreme boundary between existence and non-existence.
        Technically it is built on the Bohlen_Pierce intonation, a system of pitches set to the centrality of the 12th, rather than the 8th.
        All sounds are synthesis sounds made entirely with Csound

	  <div class="piece" id="Rossato">
		<p class="piece_title">Caged Structures IV </p>
		<p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
	  <p class="composer">Alessio Rossato</p>
	  <p class="notes">Dynamic and temporal structure of this work is inspired by the J. Cage's piece 7’10.554” for a
		percussionist, specifically the electronic realization of a voice/line (A - All Others) of the score, left
		(freely) interpretable by John Cage who did not exclude a realization (freely) with
		electronic/electroacoustic devices supports already in 1956... Realized the line A
		“electroacoustically” usable for the performance with a percussionist (original version of the score),
		this electronic material is elaborated and re-organized to give shape to different acousmatic pieces.
		The acoustic material is modeled, redesigned and sculpted to shape new pieces with common source
		material. In this way a sort of wide range of sound variations / sculptures is generated which see
		material as the main focus in the relationship between space and the vibrational energy (timbre) of
		sound. I then created a layering of the resulting “voices“ reaching the overlap of 28 independent
		voices (Digital Tracks) divided into periods. The periods are delimited by reverberated sound events
		and granulated events. My main interest is the spatial dramaturgy of music, which in this case
		allowed me to work on at least three spatial planes at the same time, hoping to have created a musical
		event that would transmit a totally immersive and engaging experience.

	  <p class="piece_title">Impro Duo </p>
	  <p class="piece_subtitle" >Instruments and Live electronics</p>
	  <p class="composer">Marijana Janevska & Joachim Heintz</p>
	  <p class="notes">This piece is an improvisation with voice and live electronics (ALMA). 
		Throughout the improvisation different atmospheres/moods/expressions are 
		built by exploring different sounds produced by the voice, like: breathing, 
		whispering, humming and so on, while being recorded, analyzed, transformed and 
		played back in different ways by ALMA. The communication and interaction 
		between the voice and the electronic instrument is extremely important- 
		they are sometimes treated like one entity, layering on top of each other 
		and sometimes like two opposites.

	  <div class="piece" id="Balighi">
	  <p class="piece_title">Daramad</p>
	  <p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
	  <p class="composer">Ali Balighi</p>
	  <p class="notes">In Persian, “Daramad” means to start music and also, it is a classical 
		form of Persian music, however, it means to learn music with a deep perspective to 
		theory and techniques for me. In this music, I tried to make a connection between 
		language from a sense point of view and fixed media as a musical atmosphere. 
		The relation between sopranos parts is based on rhythm, counterpoint movements, 
		nonmeaning words and alone letters.
		This piece won the third place in the fifth international Reza Kourorian 
		electroacoustic composition competition, and was played in the forth tehran 
		international electronic music festival (TIEMF 2021)

	  <div class="piece" id="Sosa1">
	  <p class="piece_title">Jazz </p>
	  <p class="composer">Jean-Basille Sosa</p>
	  <p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
	  <p class="notes">Jazz, without being essentially jazz or pop, looks like yet a bit
		jazz and pop music. Electroacoustic work originally composed
		for the dance, it is also for the situation of the concert
		situation. In its acousmatic concert version Jazz gives to hear
		more distinctly the principles of an ‘electronic writing’ which
		from an initial set of abstract formal ideas deploys a material
		physiologically palpable, embodied to the sensory.
		A specific consideration on the musical time as well as on the
		rhythm perception is in the heart of this work, both popular
		and abstract.

	  <div class="piece" id="Francioni">
	  <p class="piece_title">...e sempre di mirar faceasi accesa</p>
	  <p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
	  <p class="composer">Enrico Francioni</p>
	  <p class="notes">The work wants to return the sound image evoked in the mind of 
		the Supreme Poet who in Paradise is overwhelmed by the One who with "Amore", 
		"muove il sole e le altre stelle".
		The crescendo corresponds to the approach to the divine [0'00"-6'26"], 
		to reach a blinding sound texture that I love to approach the encounter with 
		the Immanent [5'00"-6'26"], unspeakable state of grace suspended and suddenly 
		interrupted [6'26”] to lead us elsewhere; perhaps to reality [6'26"-8'00"].
		In this sense the painting tries to make its own the concepts of "Inaudible" 
		and "Thresholds of perception", but also of continuous flow, circularity, 
		harmony, song and dance, the latter, well described by William Mahrt.
		It is the idea of immobility that is aimed at, which implicitly underlies the 
		silence, here conceived not as the absence of sound, but as a state of general expectation.

	  <div class="piece" id="Yang1">
	  <p class="piece_title">Ganges River Empties Itself into Ocean</p>
	  <p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed media</p>
	  <p class="composer">Wanjun Yang</p>
	  <p class="notes">The title of the piece comes from the Buddhist classics, 
		Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra. Buddha said that form is emptiness and emptiness is form.
		We come to the world with bare hands, spend our lives pursuing material 
		things and desires, and finally remain naked, taking nothing with us. 
		This piece uses a single Buddha singing bowl as the musical instrument, 
		which is one of the commonly used Dharma instruments in Buddhism. 
		The main sound material is the sound of strike and resonance of the 
		bowl, different sound modules are designed in Csound, the sound of the bowl 
		striking is picked up by microphone, processed in real time by digital signal processing. 
		The musical form of the piece is A-B-A', which expresses the process of 
		human being from the true nature at birth, to being lost in the material world, and then to realize the true meaning of life.

	  <p class="notes">Shin Kubota is a marine biologist at Kyoto University 
		and research on a species of jellyfish, Turritopsis dohrnii. If one 
		of these jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress or to physical 
		aggression, if it is sick or just old, it loses its tentacles, sinks 
		to the bottom of the sea and returns to its primitive stage, thus 
		forming a new colony. This process can continue indefinitely, making 
		this creature biologically immortal.</p>

	  <p class="piece_title">Kagemusha: for Live Pipa and Csound </p>
	  <p class="piece_subtitle">Instruments and Live Electronics</p>
	  <p class="composer">Ningxin Zhang</p>
	  <p class="notes">Inspired by Akira Kurosawa's film “Kagemusha”, 
		this duet for live pipa and electronics aims to depict how people 
		struggled in the cruelty and impermanence of ancient wars, as well 
		as the prosperity and end of a turbulent era. Musically, the pipa 
		playing and electronics are always echoing each other in the whole 
		piece. It starts with electronic sounds and slowly introduces the 
		playing of pipa. The acoustic pipa part follows traditional pipa 
		form and shows a variety of techniques of the left and right hand. 
		All the electronic sounds were generated based on the melodies played 
		by both acoustic pipa and Csound pipa, and were processed mainly with 
		Cecilia, Puremagnetik plugins and Cabbage modulation, spectral and time 
		effect plugins to create the dark atmosphere, the ferocious metallic 
		sounds of swords colliding and a state of chaos that people were suffering from.</p>

	  <p class="composer">Niall O’Connor</p>
	  <p class="piece_subtitle">Fixed Media</p>
	  <p class="notes">The underlying aim of the piece is to use lightbulb's 
		as a musical instrument and to examine all the different aspects 
		of it by looking at the finite life cycle of a lightbulb, from 
		when it first gets turned on to its inevitable demise.  
		The different stages the lightbulb passes through would parallel stages of a 
		human life.  The piece was originally intended as a reflection of my life at 
		the time and while the subject matter was open enough to allow me to explore 
		the usage of texture in the piece.  The materials and aesthetics in the 
		piece draw from varying aspects of my life and present them in one overarching 
		theme, for example some of the electrical hum’s are based around a recording 
		of meat been prepared.  At the time I was completing an apprenticeship in butchery as an extension of my love for culinary arts. </p>

	  <p class="notes">This piece is a soundscape for the poem Hope Is The Thing With Feathers by Emily Dickinson.  
		It feautures the recitation of the poem with an evolving underscore supporting and creating an immersive

	  <p class="piece_subtitle">3 Movements and Live Audience Participation (First and Second Movement)</p>
	  <p class="composer">Shijie Wang (China, )</p>

	  <p class="notes">This piece is based on author's own experience. One
	  day he was doing a boring, mechanical and repetitive work for quite a
	  long time. At the begining, he was fully concentrating on the job. As
	  time goes on, he started to lose focus, his mind started to think about
	  other non&ndash;relevant and logic&ndash;less stuff, kind of like a dream, while he
	  was still physically doing the work. Later, he even heard acousmatic
	  voices talking to himself. This piece intents to recreate this mental
	  journey. There are 3 movements. The first one is called "Distracting",
	  which describing the transition between fully focused to distracted.
	  The second movement namely "Overhearing", which means mind and spirit
	  was traveling even further from reality than that was in movement 1.
	  The final movements is called "Splitting", which insinuates that mind
	  and spirit was completely split apart from reality.</p>

	  <p class="notes"><i>First Movement:</i> Sound materials used: Sound of an
	  old&ndash;school needle printer, Sound of someone writing, and a Piano.
	  <p class="notes"><i>Second Movement:</i> Composed and performed using
	  Csound. Seven modules were defined for making sound, which are
	  <tt>instr 2</tt>, <tt>instr 20</tt> using <tt>pluck</tt> UGen for a
	  percussion&ndash;like sound; <tt>instr 3</tt>, <tt>instr 30</tt> using
	  <tt>oscil</tt> UGen with 3 different tables, <tt>instr 4</tt>, <tt>inst
	  41</tt>, <tt>inst 42</tt> using <tt>diskin2</tt> for sample playback; 5
	  modules manipulates the parameters from all the sound&ndash;providing
	  instruments and effects, which are <tt>instr 1</tt>, <tt>instr 10</tt>,
	  <tt>instr 101</tt>, <tt>instr102</tt> and <tt>instr 98</tt>; a delay
	  effect <tt>instr 99</tt>; at last, the <tt>score</tt> part which does
	  the job as its name refers.
	  <p class="notes"><i>Third Movement (not included):</i> This movement
	  includes Live Audience Participation, implemented using Web Audio API,

	  <p class="piece_title">SaxGui<span class="year">[2004]</span></p>
	  <p class="composer">Basilio Del Boca (Argentina, 1976)</p>
	  <p class="notes">SaxGui, is an acousmatic piece composed starting from
	  the combined sounds processed of Alto Saxo and Guitar. It does not
	  present in its beginning an extramusical program, but it is only a work
	  thought to obtain tensions and distensions in the textures and sonorous
	  densities, given by the sumories of sounds and by rhythmic structures
	  more or less animated.</p>
	  <p class="notes">The work was mixed using Adobe Audition. The original
	  samples of saxophone and guitar were processed using Adobe Audition
	  tools, SMS tools (by Xavier Serra), and specifically Csound: Soundin,
	  sndwarp, Butterworth and clfilt Filters (clfilt) and hrtfer. Moreover,
	  we used the application Clusters for algorithmic composition (score
	  maker, written in Visual Basic, by Basilio Del Boca), in combination
	  with Csound, with which was used to create specific sections of the
	  piece.</p>

	  <p class="piece_title">Pulso Interior <span class="year">[2017]</span></p>
	  <p class="composer">Leonardo Secco (Uruguay&ndash;Canada, 1966)</p>
	  <p class="notes">The 450 bpm pulse acts as a “binder” to sustain a
	  continuously transforming polyrhythm. This background pulse guides the
	  piece and acts as “hidden” support, allowing a complex control of all
	  the parameters to define a multi level rhythmic fabric. Internal pulse
	  is based on a generative algorithm that allows for the control of the
	  temporal, dynamic, timbral and spatial parameters of the piece by way
	  of human interaction. The result is an immersive electroacoustic
	  performance, in which percussive sounds seem to interact to configure a
	  continuously transforming virtual space.</p>

	  <p class="composer">Michele Del Prete (Italy, 1974)</p>
	  <p class="notes">Occupazione dello spazio (The occupation of space) is
	  a piece working on three modalities of the taking place of space as
	  sounding space. The piece is composed for a minimum of 8 loudspeakers
	  after the Renaissance polichoral music of the Venetian school. The
	  movements and the positions of the sound events in space determine the
	  nature of the music material (impulses, granulation, filtered white
	  noise) and not vice versa. Changements on the space scale are more
	  important of those on the time scale.</p>
	  <p class="notes">The entire piece is the result of sound synthesis
	  processes entirely made with Csound. Four instruments are used: 1)
	  impulse trains with variable filtering and reverberation; 2) a filtered
	  granulation (with variable filtering), 3 and 4) two distinct filtered
	  noise sources. Several global variables assure interdependency and
	  cross relations among the sounds generated by those instruments. Space
	  is an essential component of Occupazione dello spazio (8 tracks): its
	  elements are spatialized according to three distinct patterns (a
	  "stable&ndash;static" figuration for the impulses, an evolving form for the
	  granulation, a double choir constellation for the two noise
	  sources).</p>

	  <p class="composer">Georg Boenn (Germany, 1965)</p>
	  <p class="notes">'Ad Infinitum' is a tribute to Jean-Claude Risset,
	  composer and pioneer of Computer Music, who died in November 2016. One
	  of his many contributions was an acoustic illusion, the famous infinite
	  glissando. My composition explores his glissando in a polyphonic way by
	  using various transformations. First, the speed of the glissando is
	  continuously changed. Secondly, the harmonic series is used to
	  transpose the glissando and to transform its sound via granular
	  synthesis. Finally, several voices are composed together and projected
	  in circular movements around the auditorium.</p>
	  <p class="notes">The piece uses an implementation of Risset's glissando
	  for csound. The usual sinusoidal oscillators were replaced by
	  square&ndash;wave oscillators. The classic algorithm is further modified to
	  have a precise control over the tempo and the direction of the
	  glissando in real&ndash;time and by means of an LFO. Several versions were
	  synthesized with interaction in real&ndash;time. The sound files were further
	  processed by granular synthesis modules in Cecilia (csound and pyo
	  version). Spatialisation to a 6.1 channel output was synthesized by
	  csound using <tt>vbap</tt> opcodes. Furthermore, a trigonometric formula was
	  developed for generating accelerandi and decelerandi of two pulse
	  stream towards the end of the piece that signify a translation of
	  Risset's pitch&ndash;based glissando to a 'glissando' in the rhythmic
	  domain.</p>

	  <p class="piece_title">Vocalisense <span class="year">[2015]</span></p>
	  <p class="composer">Oscar Pablo Di Liscia (Argentina, 1955)</p>
	  <p class="notes">The title is a portmanteau for Vocalise and Sense. A
	  vocalise is a very well known kind of musical piece, and Sense stands
	  for the name of the vocal ensemble Nonsense (whose members recorded the
	  source sounds of the work). The source sounds are both speech (normal,
	  whispered, shouted) and sung (sustained eight&ndash;note chords with
	  different vowels). However, these two categories are combined or
	  transformed the one in the other trough several synthesis and
	  processing techniques. Since the work was conceived for a two dimension
	  surround sound system using the Ambisonics spatialisation technique,
	  the exploration of several “spatial paradoxes” (such as the spatial
	  dissociation of sounds from a single vocal source, the spatial
	  projection of the constituent elements of a word or a syllable, and the
	  spatial dissociation of the direct sound and its room effect) is most
	  relevant in its structure. </p>
	  <p class="notes">The piece was entirely synthesized using Csound.
	  Basically, a set of instruments that perform granulation, espectral
	  based synthesis and spatialisation designed by te author were used. The
	  code and the source sound files used are available if requested.
	  Recording Engineer of the source voice sounds: Natalia Perelman. The
	  final render of the piece is a First Order Ambisonic B-Format and must
	  be decoded for the appropriate set of loudspeakers. The spatialisation
	  of sound treatment is basically 2D (except for the early echoes and
	  dense reverberation).</p>

	  <p class="composer">Fabio De Sanctis De Benedictis (Italy, 1963)</p>
	  <p class="notes">"Al disopra dimorano gli uccelli del cielo, cantano
	  tra le fronde" is a quadraphonic electroacoustical piece. The title is
	  desumed from a Psalm, and the sound material is taken from recording of
	  bird songs, an explicit reference to Messiaen. The form wants to be a
	  trip towards highness, as if the public was inside an aviary, a
	  resemblance from composer's memory from childhood age. This trip is a
	  metaphysical one, too, because in sciamanism birds are Gods
	  messengers.</p>
	  <p class="notes">Csound and Cmask have been used to edit and spatialize
	  the sounds. Snd, the CCRMA software, has been used to create artificial
	  bird songs, for an interplay between natural and cultural/artificial.
	  The audio files have been finally edited in Ardour, with a final
	  mastering by Jamin, Linux softwares.</p>

	  <p class="piece_title">Definierte Lastbedingung <span class="year">[2016]</span></p>
	  <p class="composer">Clemens von Reusner (Germany, 1957)</p>
	  <p class="notes">“Definierte Lastbedingung” (engl. defined load
	  condition) is based upon the sounds of electromagnetic fields as they
	  arise when using electric devices. Numerous recordings of
	  electromagnetic landscapes were made at the "Institute for Electrical
	  Machines, Traction and Drives" (IMAB) of the Technical University of
	  Braunschweig (Germany) with a special microphone. This sound material
	  has little of what a “musical” sound is intrinsically. There is no
	  depth and no momentum. In their noisiness these sounds are static,
	  though moved inside. They usually seem bulky, harsh and repellent, even
	  hermetic as the well known electrical hum. “Defined load condition” (a
	  technical term when testing electrical machines) is about with these
	  sounds which are explored in their structure, reshaped and musically
	  dramatized by the means of the electronic studio. The main frequency
	  of electrical current in Europe is 50 hertz and hence 50 and its
	  multiples is also the numerical key this composition is based upon in a
	  variety of ways. Spatialization: 3rd&ndash;order ambisonic. "Definierte
	  Lastbedingung" is also the german contribution to ISCM "World New Music
	  Days" 2017 in Vancouver, Canada.</p>

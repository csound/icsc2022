            <p>
              Dr. Richard Boulanger (a.k.a. “Dr.B”), is a Professor of Electronic Production and Design at the Berklee
              College of Music, in Boston.
              He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Music from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) where he worked at
              the Center for Music Experiment’s Computer Audio Research Lab (CARL) with Dick Moore, “The Father of
              cmusic”.
              After UCSD, Boulanger continued his computer music research at The MIT Media Lab, Bell Labs, Stanford's
              CCRMA, IBM, Interval Research, and for The One Laptop Per Child Project (OLPC).
              Throughout his career, Dr.B. was a close collaborator with "The Father of Csound" - Professor Barry Vercoe
              at MIT, and “The Father of Computer Music” - Dr. Max Mathews at Bell Labs, Stanford, and Interval.
              For many years, Boulanger and Vercoe worked on Csound at MIT and on the OLPC Project, and Boulanger and
              Mathews worked on The Radio Baton, Scanned Synthesis, and Phaser Filters.
              Further, Boulanger and Mathews co-wrote papers, gave lectures and workshops, and performed Boulanger’s
              compositions together at many Colleges and Universities in the US, and abroad at many of the Bourges and
              Audio Art Festivals,
              Also, they were featured at many AES, SEAMUS, ICMC and NIME conferences. Boulanger’s ‘open source’
              masterpiece, ‘Trapped in Convert”, composed at MIT in the summer of 1979 (in Vercoe’s ‘music11’ language
              written in RT11 assembly and running on a DEC PDP11)
              and later revised at MIT in 1986 (in Vercoe’s new ‘C’ version of music11, running on a DEC-VAX11780 and
              now
              called ‘csound’), is considered to be the ‘first’ Csound piece.
              As an internationally recognized performing composer, Boulanger has premiered his original interactive
              works
              at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, DC, at Alice Tully Hall in NYC, and he has appeared on stage
              performing his Radio Baton and PowerGlove Concerto with the Newton, Brockton, New Haven, Hamilton,
              Stanford,
              Krakow and Moscow Symphonies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born in 1956, Boulanger’s first symphony (for Two Arp 2600’s and the 100+ member Newton Symphony
              Orchestra)
              was commissioned in 1977 (at the age of 21) by Alan R. Pearlman, (“The Father of the ARP 2600” and the
              President and founder of ARP Synthesizers).
              Dr. Boulanger has published articles on sound design, production and composition in all the major
              electronic
              music and music technology magazines in the US - Perspectives of New Music, Electronic Musician, Keyboard.
              He has appeared on PBS, NOVA, CBS, The Today Show, and Red Bull TV (With GZA from The Wu-Tang Clan
              controlling Csound with his brainwaves).
              Boulanger has worked with and performed with BT, Nona Hendrix, and Hank Shocklee (from Public Enemy), and
              done Csound-based sound design in several Hollywood Films and TV shows (including some Csound-based vocal
              processing of David Bowie for the SONY Film - Stealth).
              For MIT Press, Boulanger has authored and edited two canonical computer music textbooks: The Csound Book
              and
              The Audio Programming Book.
              His company, <a href= "https://boulangerlabs.com/" target="_blank">Boulanger Labs,</a> has developed Csound-based iOS apps include csJam, csGrain and csSpectral,
              and
              for the Leap Motion Controller they developed an app called MUSE and he composed and performed a major
              symphonic work built around these apps called: ‘Symphonic Muse’ - featuring soloists from the Boston
              Symphony Orchestra.
              Boulanger has received many many grants, awards, and honors… most notably, he was a Fulbright Professor at
              the Krakow Academy of Music, and at Berklee, where he has been teaching for over 36 years, ‘Dr. B.’ has
              been
              honored with both the “Faculty of the Year Award” and the “President’s Award.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Boulanger's philosophy is as follows: “For me, music is a medium through which the spiritual essence of
              all things is revealed and shared.
              Compositionally, I am interested in extending the ‘voice’ of both student and professional performers
              through technological means to help them produce a music that connects with the past, lives in the present
              and speaks to the future.
              Educationally, I am interested in helping my students to recognize, as I have, that Csound is the richest,
              most expressive, most versatile, and most powerful ‘instrument’ for their creative explorations,
              realizations, and innovations.
              Csound itself embraces and preserves the past and points to the future. It is both foundational and
              inspirational.
              With Csound, one literally stands on the shoulders of giants. Studying, and mastering this incredibly
              versatile and malleable ‘instrument’ will
              enable today’s most gifted, talented, brilliant, and curious audio artists, visionaries, and dreamers to
              create their own unique and truly personal set of musical devices, smart generative systems, new tools,
              new sounds, new instruments,
              and new ways to play, and with them, to create and communicate with an enlightened, and truly unique
              musical voice.”

              Iain McCurdy is a composer and lecturer originally from Belfast and currently based at Maynooth
              University,
              Ireland. He has been working with, and contributing to, the Csound project since 1999. His contributions
              to
              Csound have included working on the FLOSS manual project and contributing to the Springer Csound Book.
              He
              has
              also written a catalogue of over 600 interactive examples for Csound covering many of its capabilities.
              This
              resource has proved valuable for many learning the program. More recent work has focussed on the popular
              Csound front–end, Cabbage.
              Since January 2016 Iain has held the position of Lecturer in Music at the University of Maynooth
              (National
              University of Ireland) where his teaching duties cover composition, electronic music, programming and
              research
              supervision. He is currently the Director of Music Studios at Maynooth.
              As a composer his work has covered the areas of acousmatic, electroacoustic, instrumental, sound
              installation
              and cross–disciplinary works involving all four. His work with sound installations and alternative
              controller
              design has drawn in exploration of electronics, sensors and instrument building. Other foci of work are
              recording, videography, surround sound, ambisonics and other esoteric microphone technologies.
